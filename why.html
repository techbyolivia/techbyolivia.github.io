        <h2>Why I Prefer Dogs over Cats</h2>
        <p>I prefer dogs over cats because dogs are much more loyal and active. As an active person, I would love to have a pet that is similar to me, and I'd prefer a loyal and interactive pet. It just so happens that dogs perfectly match this description, so I'd love to have a dog.</p>
